<p>There are multiple ways to organize a program, and the code we&#8217;ve written to this point could be described as <em>procedural programming</em>.
In procedural programming, we organize our code into methods that perform specific tasks, and we think of a program as a series of tasks that need to be performed in a specific order.
Another popular way to think about software design is <em>object-oriented programming</em> (OOP).
In this chapter, we&#8217;ll start dip our toes into OOP by learning about <em>classes</em> and <em>objects</em>, which are the basic building blocks of OOP.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with procedural programming—and, in fact, OOP is a form of procedural programming—but it can get cumbersome as a program grows in size and complexity. And, it isn&#8217;t always an intuitive way to plan our programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Object-oriented programming lets us think about programs the way we think about the world around us.
Instead of thinking about a program as a bunch of tasks, we can think of it as a bunch of <strong>objects</strong> that interact with each other.
As an example, the old-school video game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man"><strong>Pac-Man</strong></a> has the main character (an object) moving around a maze (another object), and avoiding four ghosts (yep, four more objects).</p>

<div class="title">Example 7.1 - Pac-Man arcade game, released in 1980 by Namco</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we decide to create Pac-Man, we&#8217;ll still be using methods, but they won&#8217;t be the basic building blocks of our programs.
Instead, we&#8217;ll be organizing our programs into <strong>classes</strong>, which are blueprints—or recipes—for creating objects.
A class defines the <strong>attributes</strong> and <strong>behaviors</strong> of the objects—and those are the variables and methods we&#8217;ll write to create our programs.</p>

<h4 id="_class_diagrams">7.1.1. Class Diagrams</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In OOP, our planning for a program starts by deciding what objects—and therefore, what classes—we&#8217;ll need in order to implement the functionality we want.
To help organize our thinking, we&#8217;ll use a tool called a <strong>class diagram</strong>, which gives us a visual representation of the classes and their relationships in our program.
The format programmers use for class diagrams is called <em>Unified Modeling Language</em> (UML).
The UML standards are extensive, and we&#8217;ll be using a simplified version in this course.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consider a program that tracks inventory at a comic book shop. A simple class to represent one comic book might look like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/chapter7/ComicBookDiagram.png" alt="ComicBookDiagram" width="140" height="165">
</div>
<div class="title">Example 7.2 - A class diagram for a comic book</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The top section of the diagram has the name of the class, which is <code>ComicBook</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next section is for the attributes of the class—the information the class will store. This example has attributes for the title of the comic book, the issue number, and the price.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The bottom section is for the behaviors of the class, which are the actions the class can perform (or that we can do with the class).
With a comic book, we might sell it to a customer, buy it from a customer, or print a receipt.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ll learn more about the symbols and conventions of UML as we go along, but for now the important part is that we can use class diagrams to help us plan our programs—and to talk about OOP concepts without bogging down on code details.</p>

<h3 id="_encapsulation">7.2. Encapsulation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Object-oriented programming is all about creating objects that can interact with each other.
Since the objects will be interacting, we need to think about how to keep them from interfering with each other in ways we don&#8217;t want.
If we have a <code>ComicBook</code> class in a program used by a shop, we don&#8217;t want some other class to change attributes in a way that disrupts the program—like setting the price to zero, or making the issue number a negative number, for example.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To prevent this kind of tampering, whether it&#8217;s intentional or accidental, OOP relies on a concept called <strong>encapsulation</strong>.
Encapsulation of a class means that attributes are hidden from the outside world, and only the behaviors of the class can access and change them.
For another analogy, consider a vending machine.
We can&#8217;t just reach in and grab a candy bar; we have to pay and use the buttons on the machine.
In this analogy, the snacks are encapsulated and we can only access them by using a behavior, like "buy candy" (which would work with the buttons).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another way to think of encapsulation is the way we interact with other people in social situations.
When we encounter a stranger, they don&#8217;t automatically know our name and phone number; they have to ask us for that information.
We&#8217;ve encapsulated our personal information, and we only share it when and how we choose to.</p>
</div>

<td class="content">
In C#, encapsulation is not a strict technical requirement, and our code will still work if we don&#8217;t use it.
But it&#8217;s a best practice—and an important one—so we will encapsulate all of our classes in this course.

This is similar to the <em>camelCase</em> naming convention we&#8217;ve been using for variables, and it&#8217;s the same convention we&#8217;ve been using for methods; it&#8217;s called <em>PascalCase</em>.</p>

A field is unique to the object; if we make two objects from our <code>PoolRecord</code> class, each object will have its own date, high temperature, and average temperature.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fields are declared like our other variables, but they are encapsulated using the <code>private</code> access modifier.
This means that the fields can only be accessed and changed by the methods or properties of the class, not by other classes—which controls how the data is used and prevents accidental or invalid changes.</p>

<p>You might remember from <a href="_methods.html#_variable_scope">the section on variable scope in Chapter 3</a> that using global variables is terrible, and every time we create a global variable, a puppy loses its favorite toy.
And these fields look an awful lot like global variables.
But fields in a class are <strong>not</strong> global variables; they&#8217;re <strong>instance</strong> variables—and that&#8217;s a good thing.
The fields are <strong>encapsulated</strong> with that <code>private</code> keyword, so they can only be accessed and changed by the methods and properties of the class—which is also good thing.
And the fields are unique to each object, so we can have multiple objects with different values for the fields—which is yet another a good thing.
And so no puppies' toys will be harmed as long as we use that <strong>private</strong> keyword.</p>

<h4 id="_methods_2">7.3.2. Methods</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ensuring that our fields are <code>private</code> is the first step in encapsulating our class, but it&#8217;s not the only step.
We also need to create methods that can access and change the fields appropriately—otherwise, the fields are not very useful.
So far, our methods have included the keyword <code>static</code>; we&#8217;ll learn more about that shortly, but when we make methods for an OOP class, we&#8217;ll leave off that <code>static</code> keyword.
These <em>nonstatic</em> methods are called <strong>instance methods</strong>, and they are otherwise very similar to the <code>static</code> methods we&#8217;ve been using.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For now, our instance methods will be <code>public</code> so they can be accessed from other classes.
Remember, the foundation of encapsulation is having <code>private</code> fields and <code>public</code> methods to permit interactions with that data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In broad terms, we can categorize instance methods into two types: <strong>accessor</strong> methods and <strong>mutator</strong> methods.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_accessor_methods">Accessor Methods</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Accessor methods give access to the fields of the class, but they don&#8217;t change the fields.
Think of them as "read only" methods, and often all they do is return the value of a field.
C# naming conventions specify that accessor methods should start with <code>Get</code> and then the name of the field they access, formatted in PascalCase.
Because of that convention, another name for accessor methods is <strong>getters</strong>.</p>

<p>Mutator methods change the fields of the class.
Though they sometimes return a value, their primary purpose is to change the value of a field and they often have a <code>void</code> return type.
As we&#8217;re getting the hang of this OOP thing, we&#8217;ll create a lot of mutator methods that are just <strong>setters</strong>—methods that set the value of a field.
The naming convention for setters is to start with <code>Set</code> and then the name of the field they change, formatted in PascalCase; they usually have a void return type.</p>

<p>The parameter of a setter is the same type as the field it changes; in this case <code>waterTemp</code> is an <code>int</code>, so the parameter of our setter is also an <code>int</code>.
All this method does is accept a new value and assign it to the field.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Choosing to write setters isn&#8217;t quite as straightforward as with getters, where there&#8217;s generally no harm in exposing read-only access to everything.
But we really should only write setters for fields that we want to be able to change from outside the class.</p>

<td class="content">
A rule of thumb for beginners: create <strong>getters</strong> for all of your fields when you first write your class, and then add <strong>setters</strong> only as you need them. Because this is sometimes tricky for beginners to determine, I generally don&#8217;t deduct points for writing unnecessary setters—but sometimes my directions will explicitly tell you not to write a setter for a field, and I do deduct in that case.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re paying attention to what we&#8217;re doing here, you might be thinking that these setters really just give public access to the fields, which seems to go against the whole idea of encapsulation.
That&#8217;s true for now, but only because we&#8217;re starting with some basic examples.
As we get the hang of this OOP stuff, we&#8217;ll write more complex methods that can control <strong>how</strong> fields are changed—for example, by using <code>if</code> statements to check that a new value is valid and won&#8217;t break anything.
But for now, this is just another one of those frustrating rules that you just have to follow because your teacher is unreasonable.</p>

<p>Sometimes mutator methods don&#8217;t follow the exact pattern and purpose of setters (simply setting a field&#8217;s value).
For example, a method might perform a series of calculations and changes to multiple fields, or it might change a field based on the value of another field.
These methods are still mutators, and we might even still refer to them as <em>setters</em>, but they don&#8217;t always follow the <code>SetFieldName</code> naming convention.</p>

<h4 id="_using_the_class">7.3.3. Using the Class</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we&#8217;ve learned, defining a class establishes a blueprint; to make use of a class in a program, we need to use that blueprint to create an object.
We can as many objects from a class as we need, and each object is known as an <strong>instance</strong> of the class.
And creating an instance is called <strong>instantiating</strong> a class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To create our first objects, we use the same two steps we&#8217;ve been using to create variables: a declaration statement and an assignment statement.
The declaration is still a <em>data type</em> and an _identifier, but in this case the data type is the name of the class:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Example 7.10 - A declaration statement for an object.</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight" style="background: #272822; color: #f8f8f2"><code data-lang="csharp"><div class="lineno"><table class="linenotable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span style="color: inherit; background-color: transparent; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px;">1</span></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #f8f8f2">PoolRecord day1;</span>
</pre></div></td></tr></table></div></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This creates a variable called <code>day1</code> that will point to (or <em>reference</em>) the memory location where our object will be stored.
The identifier follows the same rules we learned for our basic variables: a descriptive name typed in camelCase (with a lowercase first letter).
In this case, the <code>day1</code> object is going to maintain the record for the first day of our pool water tracking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The assignment statement works the same, but what we&#8217;re assigning looks a lot different.
We&#8217;ll use the <code>new</code> keyword to allocate memory, and then we&#8217;ll call a <strong>constructor</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Example 7.11 - An assignment statement for a newly declared object.</div>
<div class="content">

</pre></div></td></tr></table></div></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;re soon going to spend time learning about constructors, but here is the takeaway for now: the identifier is exactly the same as the class name, and it&#8217;s followed by parentheses.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i>

<td class="content">
We&#8217;ve already learned that the presense of parentheses in C# usually means we&#8217;re referring to a method. A constructor is a special method called when instantiating an object.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just like with variables, we often combine those two statements into one line of code:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Example 7.12 - A combined declaration and instantiation statement.</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight" style="background: #272822; color: #f8f8f2"><code data-lang="csharp"><div class="lineno"><table class="linenotable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span style="color: inherit; background-color: transparent; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px;">1</span></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #f8f8f2">PoolRecord day1 </span><span style="color: #ff4689">=</span><span style="color: #f8f8f2"> </span><span style="color: #66d9ef">new</span><span style="color: #f8f8f2"> PoolRecord();</span>
</pre></div></td></tr></table></div></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that we have an object, we can call its instance methods using <em>dot notation</em>, which means we put the object name (<strong>not</strong> the class name!), followed by a dot, followed by the method call:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Example 7.13 - Instance method calls using dot notation.</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight" style="background: #272822; color: #f8f8f2"><code data-lang="csharp"><div class="lineno"><table class="linenotable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span style="color: inherit; background-color: transparent; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px;">1</span>

<span style="color: #f8f8f2">day1.SetWaterTemperature(</span><span style="color: #ae81ff">87</span><span style="color: #f8f8f2">);</span>
<span style="color: #f8f8f2">Console.WriteLine(</span><span style="color: #e6db74">&quot;Water temperature on day 1:&quot;</span><span style="color: #f8f8f2"> </span><span style="color: #ff4689">+</span><span style="color: #f8f8f2"> day1.GetWaterTemperature());</span>
</pre></div></td></tr></table></div></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this example, we&#8217;re setting the <code>waterTemperature</code> field of <code>day1</code> to 87 degrees, and then we&#8217;re retrieving the water temperature and outputting the returned value.
This is a good test of the <em>set</em> and <em>get</em> methods for the <code>waterTemperature</code> field.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s easy for beginners to forget to use that dot notation.
To see why it&#8217;s necessary, consider the following example.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

</pre></div></td></tr></table></div></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we left off the <code>day1.</code> part of the call, the compiler would not know which <code>SetWaterTemperature()</code> method to use, <code>day1</code> or <code>day2</code>.
And even when we only have one instance, the compiler needs to know where to find that method, so the dot notation is required every time we call an instance method.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_object_classes_vs_driver_classes">Object Classes vs. Driver Classes</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ok, time for another convention that seems only intended to be nitpicky and pointless, but is important and is expected on assignments in this course.
OOP nerds value keeping the different parts of our programs compartmentalized, and that includes separating the class definition from the code that uses the class.
A class we define for use as object can be called an <strong>object class</strong> or a <strong>user-defined class</strong> (where the "user" in this case is the programmer).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The code that <strong>uses</strong> the <em>object class</em> should be in a separate class, and is often called a <strong>driver class</strong>.
The driver class contains the <code>Main()</code> method, which is the entry point for the program.
A driver class actually goes by several different names.
Some people call it a <em>main class</em> because, well, it&#8217;s the class with the <code>Main()</code> method; I don&#8217;t hear that term a lot, but it is out there.
I often use the terms <em>demo class</em> or <em>test class</em> because, as learners, we&#8217;re often making a class just to try a specific concept or skill, and the only thing our program really does is show that the object class is working.
And in those cases, we often see "test" or "demo"; so a driver class for our <code>PoolRecord</code> object class might be called <code>PoolRecordDemo</code> or <code>TestPoolRecord</code>, or something similar.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The point here is that, if we&#8217;ve created an object class called <code>PoolRecord</code>, we&#8217;re not going to put our <code>Main()</code> method in that same class/file.
We&#8217;re going to make a separate class—a driver, or demo class, or test class.
I don&#8217;t much care what term you use, as long as it&#8217;s a separate class.</p>

In C#, you might using top-level statements, which allow you to write code outside of a class. In that case, the top-level statements act as the driver code, and you still keep your object classes in separate files.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your pitchforks are already sharpened, but here&#8217;s the part where you light your torches.
<strong>All of your input and output should be in the driver class.</strong>
That is, you generally can&#8217;t have any <code>Write()</code>, <code>WriteLine()</code>, or <code>ReadLine()</code> statements in your object classes.
My examples always enforce this <em>separation of concerns</em>, so you&#8217;ll have plenty of examples of what I mean.</p>

<p>I asked an AI platform to give me an image of an angry mob with pitchforks and torches (coming after me because I make them separate their input and output), and the AI spit out this <a href="images/chapter7/creepy_mob.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nightmare fuel</a>.
I decided it was too creepy to display in the text, but this crime against nature should be preserved for posterity. If a mob like that comes for me, I&#8217;ll let them put <code>Write()</code> statements wherever they want!</p>

<p>Why can&#8217;t we put input/output in our object classes?</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>To "decouple" the UI from the <em>business logic</em> or guts of our program. This makes our code reusable in a variety of projects, such as web pages, mobile apps, and GUI applications—none of which are friendly to console input and output. Look up the terms <strong>MVC</strong> and <strong>MVVM</strong> for all kinds of information about that if you think your professor is just a crank and you want to know what happens in the <em>real world</em>. Spoiler alert, the real world generally wants them kept separate, too.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Incidentally, we might use the term <em>portability</em> to describe this quality, since we can move our well-designed code to other projects and copntexts easily.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>To keep our code more readable by keeping the different parts clearly identifiable and easy to find.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because I just don&#8217;t care much about input and output. I care about the classes you create, so I want to look at (and grade) that work separately. If your input and output don&#8217;t work but your object class looks good, you&#8217;re still going to get a good grade—but I can only do that if I&#8217;m able to separate out those mistakes.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, this is one of those things that boils down to, "because I said so" and "you&#8217;ll thank me later."
Sorry, I can&#8217;t do much better than that for now.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The setters we&#8217;ve seen to this point don&#8217;t actually do anything other than set the value of a field to whatever is passed to them.
In other words, they are no different than making the fields <code>public</code>—which, as we&#8217;ve learned, is a bad practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can improve our setters by adding some code to <em>validate</em> the data before changing the field.
Data validation is the process of ensuring that the data being used is correct and appropriate.
In the context of a setter, we can make sure that the new value being passed to the setter meets certain criteria before we assign it to the field.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In our <code>PoolRecord</code> class, we have a field for the ph level of the pool water.
The ph level of water is measured on a scale from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral (and anything below 7 being <em>acidic</em>, and anything above 7 being <em>basic</em>).
Our setter for the <code>phLevel</code> field should ensure that the new value is within that range before assigning it to the field.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">A setter with data validation.</div>
<p>public void SetPhLevel(double phLevel)
{
    if (phLevel &gt;= 0.0 &amp;&amp; phLevel &#8656; 14.0)
    {
        this.phLevel = phLevel;
    }
}</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>In this example, the setter checks if the new `phLevel` value is between 0.0 and 14.0 (inclusive) before assigning it to the field.
If the value is outside that range, the setter just does nothing—which is a simple way to handle invalid data.
We'll eventually learn more sophisticated ways to handle invalid data, but for now this is sufficient.

==== Properties

// TODO: Properties content and video
// Is this the correct place for it?

In some programming languages—most notably Java—all encapsulation is handled using methods, as we've seen to this point.
However, C# includes a feature called *properties* that can simplify encapsulation.
A _property_ is kind of like a combination of a field and a method; it looks like a field when we use it, but it has the functionality of methods behind the scenes.
It allows us to encapsulate a field and control access to it, without having to write separate getter and setter methods.

By convention, properties are typically named the same as the field they encapsulate, but with the first letter capitalized (PascalCase).
The property is followed by a code block in which we definte the `get` and `set` accessors.
Those accessors, in turn, have code block that define what happens when the property is accessed or changed—and that code will look much like the code in in a traditional getter or setter method.

=== Constructors
When we instantiate a new object, the syntax includes a call to a method, immediately following the `new` keyword:

`WeatherRecord day1 = new *WeatherRecord()*;`

This is a call to a special method called a *constructor*.
A constructor runs when an object is instantiated, and it's used to set up the object with any initial values or behaviors.
A constructor's primary job is to initialize the fields of the object—to give each instance variable a value.
If we don't write a constructor, the compiler will create one for us; it's called a default constructor, and it will set all fields to their default values.
For example, numeric fields like `int` and `double` will be set to zero, and `string` fields will be set to `null`.
We've been using setters to change those initial values to what we want, but we can also write our own constructors to set those values when the object is created.

Constructors are a special kind of method, so their syntax is a little different from other methods.
A constructor is always public, it has no return type (not even `void`), and its name is the same as the class name.

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The most important job of a constructor is setting values for each field of the object.
As a beginner, our rule of thumb is to just make a simple assignment statement for each field.

</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Since our `WeatherRecord` class has three fields, we've got three assignment statements in our constructor.
We can initialize those fields to any value we want, but we should choose values that make sense for the object; whatever we put there will be the default values that each object gets when it is instantiated.

Constructors should be written at the top of the class, before the fields and methods.

NOTE: This constructor is called a *parameterless* constructor because it doesn't have any parameters in the parentheses. It's technically *not* a default constructor, because we wrote it ourselves rather than letting the compiler do it, but so many people call it a default constructor that the term is used more often than _parameterless constructor_.

Constructors can also have parameters, which allows us to pass values to the constructor when we instantiate an object.
This is useful when we want to set the initial values of the fields to something specific, rather than the default values.
We add parameters to our constructor just like we do with any other method, by listing the data type and identifier in the parentheses.

<pre>To use this constructor, we pass a `string` value when we instantiate the object:

`WeatherRecord day1 = new WeatherRecord("1998-01-25");`

There are a couple of important things to note about this example:

1. This constructor only has one parameter but it still has three assignment statements. All fields need values, so if we don't have a parameter to get a field's value, we need to set it to a default value.

2. The parameter has the same name as the field: `date`. This is a common practice, but it's potentially confusing.
And it also violates guidance I gave you when we learned about &lt;&lt;_variable_scope,variable scope&gt;&gt;.
+
In this case, the parameter is a _local variable_ to the constructor, and it's _shadowing_ the field. Our assignment statement needs to be carefully written: `this.date` refers to the field, and `date` refers to the parameter.

We can also &lt;&lt;_overloading_a_method,overload&gt;&gt; constructors, which means we can have multiple constructors with different parameters—just like we can with any other method.
That can include having a parameterless constructor and one or more constructors with parameters, or having multiple constructors with different numbers of parameters.

==== Constructors and Encapsulation

Constructors allow us to be stricter with our encapsulation since now we don't have to have setters to put data into our objects.
We can provide a constructor to accept all the data the object needs, decide if we give access to change a field after the object has been instantiated.

For example, if we're making a bank account object, we'd need to provide an account number when we create the account, but we probably shouldn't allow the account number to be changed after the account is created.
In that case, our constructor would accept the account number, but we wouldn't provide a setter for the account number.


// TODO: review idea of static constants
=== `static` Methods and Constants

Since we first started learning about &lt;&lt;_0011_methods,methods&gt;&gt;, we've been using the `static` keyword as part of those definitions.
And though you're probably using &lt;&lt;_first_c_program,top-level statements&gt;&gt; in your programs, we've also seen the `static` keyword in front of the `Main()` method when we create a program the "old fashioned" way.
However, we haven't had enough context to understand what that keyword means.

With objects, we've learned about _instance members_, which are the fields and methods that belong to an object.
Fields are instance variables, which means that each object has its own copy of the field that can be changed without affecting other objects.
Instance methods are the code that an object can run, and they can access and change the fields of the object.
Instance members are defined *without* using the `static` keyword, so we refer to them as _nonstatic_ members.

When we use the `static` keyword, we're creating a _class member_—a field or method that belongs to the class itself, not to any object created from the class.
Put another way, a class member is shared by all objects created from the class, and it can be accessed without even creating an object.

`Console` is a class that includes the `Write()` and `WriteLine()` methods we've been using, and they are class methods declared with the  `static` keyword.
Since they're `static`, we can call them without creating a `Console` object:

[source,csharp]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>If `WriteLine()` was an instance method (without the `static` keyword), we'd have to create a `Console` object before we could call it:</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Console myConsole = new Console();    // Don&#8217;t do this!
myConsole.WriteLine("Hello, World!"); // It&#8217;s not necessary!</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>That would be a pain, so we're glad that `WriteLine()` is `static`.

In C#, when we create a &lt;&lt;_declaring_constants,constant&gt;&gt; (using the `const` keyword), that constant is implicitly (automatically) static, so we don't include the `static` keyword.
When we put a constant in an object class, we're creating a value that is shared by all objects created from the class.
If we have a savings account class, a common example when learning OOP, we might have a constant for the interest rate.
This would mean that every savings account would earn the same interest rate, which is often how banks work.

[caption="Example {chapter-number}.{counter:source-counter} - "]

C# also has a `readonly` keyword, which is similar to `const`, but it allows us to set the value of the constant in a constructor. In other words, can can define a constant but set the value at runtime. That's beyond our scope here, but you can https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/readonly[read about it^] if you're interested.

// === Programming Paradigms
// TODO: Move "programming paradigm" content to the chapter on oop?
// This was removed from Chapter 1.

// NOTE: THIS CONTENT HAS BEEN UPDATED A LITTLE IN SKIMPY-OOP!

// A paradigm is a model or example, or maybe better described as a way of seeing things—which is helpful to think about, since we can all have different ways of seeing how a problem could be solved.

// Imagine that your crazy uncle wants to pay you to go through the junk in his garage and organize his giant collection of vinyl records.
// Or imagine it's a collection of books, if that's what you prefer.
// How would you organize the collection?
// You could group them by artist and then arrange them alphabetically, from https://youtu.be/xFrGuyw1V8s?si=2N4W5250-YP5Pdth[ABBA] to https://youtu.be/F2HH7J-Sx80?si=ByL5Vr4VVYmDA8Rv[Warren Zevon].
// Or you could group them by genres (keeping disco separate from rock \'n' roll), or just put them in the order they were released.

// There are tons of different ways to do it.
// None of them are really right or wrong, it just depends on what you prefer—or maybe on how you plan to find things later.
// Coding is similar, in that we all have different ways we imagine organizing a program or solving a problem.
// That's kinda the idea of a programming paradigm: how do you think about the program you're creating?
// How do you picture it being organized?

// Just like programming languages, paradigms are numerous.
// In fact, some languages were created specifically to work well with a certain paradigm, and that's one reason there are so many languages.
// But when someone is going to learn to code, there are often two paradigms we consider:

// * Procedural Programming
// * Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

// They have a lot in common, and in fact, OOP is actually a type of procedural programming.
// Programmers love to argue why one approach is better than the other, in the same way some of my friends might argue about Ford trucks vs. Chevy trucks.
// And just like Ford vs. Chevy, there's nothing inherently better about one paradigm or the other—sorry friends, but Ford and Chevy trucks are basically the same.
// Growing up, my own first coding experiences were exclusively with procedural programming, and I stayed in that world until I began teaching Java—now I very much prefer OOP, both for my own programming and for teaching beginning coders.
// But that really is a personal preference, and I wouldn't argue that OOP is _better_ than procedural programming.

// Well, I wouldn't argue _much_.

// ==== Comparing Procedural Programming and OOP

// In procedural programming, we break up a program into the tasks we need to complete.
// Each individual task is handled by a set of statements that we call a *procedure*.
// If we need to calculate a student's overall course grade, for example, we write a procedure to do it.

// The data for our program—the stuff we're keeping track of—is stored somewhere else.
// If a procedure needs something to complete its task, that data is sent to the procedure, which then sends back a result.
// In short, information is kept separate from the code that uses it and is passed back and forth as necessary.

// .Passing data in procedural programming
// image::ProceduralProgramming.png[Diagram of data passing in procedural programming, 400]

// Many programming languages (including Python) refer to procedures as *functions*, and the term *subroutines* is also used in some cases; if you've done some programming in any language, you've almost certainly used procedures in some form.

// In OOP, the focus shifts from procedures to *objects*, which are programming elements that bundle data with the procedures that use it, instead of keeping them separate.
// We'll explore the nature of objects in great detail going forward, so we won't worry about describing it too much for now.

// I have my own biases about the topic.
// I tend to think OOP lends itself especially well to things like graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and games, as well as large projects developed by teams of programmers.

// The bottom line is that, when faced with a programming task or project, my brain immediately starts thinking in terms of the _objects_ the program will need.
// But that's probably just a matter of habit; as I mentioned, I spent much of my life (including all of the time I spent as a professional programmer) seeing programs as a bunch of procedures.

// In this course, we'll focus on procedural programming early on, but we'll learn the basics of OOP later on.

Arrays will be our first real exploration of the idea of data structures.
Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data so that we can use it more efficiently.
Data structures are a fundamental part of computer science, and they are used in almost every program we write.
Arrays aren't necessarily the best data structure for every situation, but they are a good place to start.

=== Arrays and Indexes

The variables we've used to this point can only store one piece of data at a time, and sometimes we need to store more than that.
For example, we might need to store a list of items to buy at the grocery store.
I could create a variable for each item, but that would be a lot of variables to keep track of.
Arrays give us a way to store multiple pieces of data in a single collection.

Each individual value in an array can be referred to as an _element_.
Each element in an array has a unique _index_ that tells us where it is in the array.
The number of elements in an array is called the _length_ of the array.
The first element in an array has an index of 0, the second element has an index of 1, and so on.
The last element in an array is always the length of the array minus one.
If our grocery list has 5 items, the indexes of the items would be 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

=== Defining and Using Arrays

In Java, arrays are objects, so they have to be created with the `new` keyword, and array identifiers use square brackets `[` and `]` to specify index numbers.

TIP: Any time you see square brackets in Java, you're dealing with an array.

The syntax to declare and initialize an array is as follows.

[source,java,linenums]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>String[] groceryItems = new String[5];</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>This code creates an array of `String` objects called `groceryItems` that can hold 5 elements.

Once we have an array, we can assign values to its elements using the index, which is placed in square brackets after the array name:
[source,java,linenums]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>groceryItems[0] = "milk";
groceryItems[1] = "eggs";
groceryItems[2] = "bread";
groceryItems[3] = "butter";
groceryItems[4] = "cheese";</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Each element in the array is assigned a value, and the index is used to specify which element is being assigned.

Once we have values in an array, we can access them using the index.
The element is just like any other variable, so we can use it in expressions, pass it to methods, and so on.

[source,java,linenums]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>System.out.println("The first item on the list is " + groceryItems[0]);
System.out.println("The last item on the list is " + groceryItems[4]);
groceryItems[2] = "bananas";
System.out.println("Bread has been replaced with " + groceryItems[2]);</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>When using arrays, we have to be careful to stay within the _bounds_ of the array—the upper and lower limits of the array indexes.
If we try to access an element that doesn't exist, we'll get an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
This is a runtime exception, so it won't be caught by the compiler, and it will cause our program to crash.
The lower bound of an array is always zero, so any index less that 0 is out of bounds.
The upper bound is always the length of the array minus one, so any index greater than or equal to the length of the array is out of bounds.
In our grocery list example, any index greater than 4 would be out of bounds.

=== Traversing Arrays

Working with individual elements in an array can be useful, but to really see the power of arrays, we need loops.
With a loop, we can easily move through an array and perform some task or operation on each element.
For example, if we have an array of quiz scores, we could use a loop to add up all the scores and calculate the average.

When we use a loop to go through an array, we are _traversing_ the array.
To traverse an array means to go through each element in the array, one at a time, and do something with it.
We can use a traversal to put values into an array (which we call _populating_ the array), to modify values in an array, or to read values from an array.
We can also use a traversal to search for something within an array.

Most of the time, we'll use a simple `for` loop to traverse an array.

.Example of a `for` loop to traverse an array
[source,java,linenums]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>int scores[] = {90, 85, 95, 88, 92};
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; scores.length; i++)
{
    sum += scores[i];
}
System.out.println("The sum of the scores is " + sum);</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>In this example, we have an array of quiz scores.
We use a `for` loop to go through each element of the array and add it to the `sum` variable.
Using a variable like `sum` to accumulate a value is a common pattern in programming, and we refer to such as variable as an _accumulator_.
Notice that we declare and initialize it before the loop, and then we update it inside the loop.
If we declare it inside the loop, it will be reset to zero each time the loop body runs, and we won't get the correct sum.
It also wouldn't be accessible outside of the loop due to its scope.

// TODO: update `Arrays` reference for C#

NOTE: At this point, clever clever or resourceful students point out that we could get the sum of the scores without using a loop at all, using the `Arrays` class from the `java.util` package. Sure, but since we're learning about loops, that would defeat the point. My assignments for this chapter assess your ability to write loops, so you won't get any points for code that doesn't at least try to traverse the array.

In the example, notice that we use the `length` property of the array to set the loop condition.
That way, this same loop will work for any array of any size.
If we hard-coded the size of the array into the loop, we would have to change our code every time we changed the size of the array.

.Example of a hard-coded loop
[source,java,linenums]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>int scores[] = {90, 85, 95, 88, 92};
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)
{ // Uh oh! What if we decide to hold more scores?
    sum += scores[i];
}
System.out.println("The sum of the scores is " + sum);</p>

=== Putting Objects in Arrays

In Java, an array can hold a primitive type, like an `int`, or an object.
We've been using arrays of Strings, which are objects, but students sometimes don't realize that they can also create arrays of objects they define themselves.

If we were to define a GroceryItem class with fields for the name and the aisle where it's located, we could create an array of GroceryItem objects.

[source,java,linenums]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GroceryItem[] groceryItems = new GroceryItem[5];
groceryItems[0] = new GroceryItem("milk", 4);
groceryItems[1] = new GroceryItem("eggs", 9);
groceryItems[2] = new GroceryItem("bread", 7);
groceryItems[3] = new GroceryItem("butter", 4);
groceryItems[4] = new GroceryItem("cheese", 4);</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Putting objects in an array expands the possibilities of what we can do with arrays.
Our array can hold multiple objects, and each object can have multiple fields—this allows arrays to manage large amounts of data in a single collection.

=== "For-Each" Loops

Because array traversal is such a common task, Java provides a special kind of loop that makes it easier to traverse an array.
It is officially known as an _enhanced for loop_, but it is often called a "for-each loop" because it goes through each element in the array.
A for-each loop is easy to write, and because it handles index management for us, it is less error-prone than a traditional for loop.
However, it is less flexible than a traditional for loop: we can't use it when we need to know the index of the element we're working with, or when we need to move through the array in a different order.

NOTE: The for-each loop is optional. You can always use a traditional for loop to traverse an array, and you'll need to know how to do that for the assignments in this chapter. None of our assignments require the use of a for-each loop.

=== Graphical User Interfaces

Until now, we've been creating _console applications_, in which the entire user interface is text-based.
Though many utility applications are text-based, those are generally used by "power users," software developers, and system administrators.
End users are used to applications that rely graphical elements to interact with the user.
This is called a _graphical user interface_, which is abbreviated as _GUI_ and pronounced "gooey."

GUIs on desktop and laptop computers have elements like windows, buttons, text fields, and checkboxes, and the user interacts using a mouse or touchpad.
These GUI elements are called _widgets_ or _controls_. Mobile applications have similar widgets, but they are designed for touchscreens and are generally more simplified than desktop applications.

// TODO: Forms vs MAUI, etc.
=== The Swing Library

The code required to create and display a functioning GUI is complex and far beyond our current skills, but we can use pre-built GUI widgets written by other developers.
These are typically bundled into _libraries_, or _frameworks_, that we can use in our own programs.
The two most common GUI frameworks for Java are called _Swing_ and _JavaFX_; we'll use Swing in this course because it's a little simpler for beginners and does not require any additional installations.

NOTE: JavaFX is newer and more powerful than Swing, but it's also more complex and has a steeper learning curve. The concepts learned in Swing will transfer to JavaFX, so learning Swing is a great place to start.

To use Swing classes, we simply need to add an `import` statement at the top of our Java file:

`import javax.swing.*;`

We'll begin by instantiating a `JFrame` object, which is the main window of our application.
We can use setters on the `JFrame` object to set attributes like the title and size of the window; we'll also want to set the attribute that determines what happens when the user closes the window.
We can then add other widgets to the frame, like buttons, text fields, and labels.
Finally, we'll set the frame to be visible, which will cause the window to appear on the screen.

'''

An important part of coding—and a tremendously important part of the software development industry—is testing our work to verify that it works as intended.
This is somewhat separate from the topic of &lt;&lt;_debugging_and_generative_ai,debugging&gt;&gt;, where we focus on tracking down and correcting issues once we know they are present.

Here, we want to talk about a structured approach to validating our code as we work.

=== Real-World Software Testing

For organizations that develop software, testing is not just a critical part of the development process, it can be a matter of staying in business.
Users expect software to work, and they'll move on to something else if it doesn't.

In an organizated development environment, the core of a testing strategy is using automated tests to check that each part of the software works as intended.
Developers use a testing framework—a library of tools and methods—to create and run _unit tests_.
A unit test is a small piece of code that checks a specific part of the software.
For example, in a video game there might be a method that adds points to the player's score.
Unit tests could be configured to automatically call the method with a variety of different values to make sure it totals the score correctly.
With a few clicks, the developer can run all of the tests and vie a report of which tests passed and which failed.

A big advantage of automated testing is that it enables rigorous _regression testing_.
Instead of just assuming that a block of code is good because we tested it when we wrote it, regression testing runs all the tests every time we make a change to the code.
This way, we can catch problems that other parts of the program might cause—like suddenly passing in a negative number to that score method.

We're beginners here, so we won't be using a testing framework or maintaining regression tests, but it's important to have a sense of how things work in the job market.

=== Test Cases

We're going to use a very simplified version of unit testing that we'll call _test cases_.
A test case is a set of inputs and the expected output.

=== Using Test Cases "Properly"

You can look at test cases in two ways:

* A hoop my professor makes me jump through
* A technique that can help me develop my programs quicker

You can see my bias in those two options, of course, but that doesn't mean it's not true.
Since we're just writing out or test cases in our comment block, the person looking at your work (i.e., your professor) can't tell if you used the test cases in a meaningful way or just tacked them on at the end.

Well, sometimes the professor can tell—if you turn in code that has a clear mistake that could have been easily caught using our test cases strategy.

Anyway, here's how we should be integrating testing into our development process:

1. Identify the program requirements. In other words, read the problem.
2. Develop at least three test cases—*including* the results you expect for each—that will confirm the program meets those requirements. Document them at the top of your code.
    * If necessary or helpful, write the steps you went through to develop the test cases. This should provide a great guide for the code you'll need to write.
3. Developing your code in iterations. Huh? We mean, write a little code and test it. Fix that little bit if necessary, then move on to the next piece. That testing should use the inputs from your test cases. The program won't produce the expected output/results, but that's okay. You're going to be using something to test your code, so it might as well be your test cases.
4. Keep developing your program until all of your test cases pass.
5. Review the requirements to make sure you haven't missed anything.
6. Bask in the glory of your "A" on the assignment

=== Software Development Process (SDLC content from OOP book)


Learning to write code means creating a lot of programs—mostly small, straightforward programs at first.
Remember those awful word problems where a train leaves Chicago traveling 40 mph, and another train leaves Denver at 35 mph?
That kind of stuff; but in my course, we don't get too caught up in the math part of it.
But we care *a lot* about understanding the requirements of a program and implementing it successfully.

As our programs become bigger and more complex, we'll need to work within a deliberate design and implementation process in order to keep ourselves organized and focused.
Even the smaller programs we'll develop while learning the basics will benefit from a thoughtful approach beyond just opening a new file and starting to type.
It ensures that we use our time efficiently.
And when we are faced with solving a programming problem that really intimidates us, the process will help make the task more approachable.

For big or small projects, a good general approach to software development is:

Analysis:: Identify the goals and scope of the program. As a rule, keep it small and focused—we can always add features later. *Ask yourself, _What does this program need to do?_*
Testing Plan:: Determine how the final program will be tested. The testing plan will be useful, but most importantly, taking the time to establish a specific testing plan ensures that we thoroughly understand the program before we begin writing code. If we don't know how the program will work, we're not yet ready to begin coding. *Ask yourself, _How will I make sure the program works correctly?_*
Implementation:: Write and test the code. We say that this is an _iterative_ (or "repeating") process, meaning we'll write and test one small piece, staying with it until we know it's good. Then we'll move on to the next piece and repeat. *Ask yourself, _What code do I need in order to get the next part of the program working?_*
Revise or maintain:: If our needs or program requirements change, we'll need to go back to the first step and begin planning the next version. If not, we'll need to monitor that the program continues to perform as expected over time. *Ask yourself, _What's next for this program?_*

We'll flesh out this process as we go—and as our programs become more advanced.

[.subtitle]
Sample answers to "Check Yourself..." questions

When you buy an album on vinyl, the liner notes (or "jacket notes") are the information that's printed on the back of the sleeve or, for music on CD or cassette, in a booklet inside the plastic case.
Basic liner notes are just the song titles, and the names of the artists and producers.
But sometimes you get lucky, and the liner notes have blurbs written by the artists, or maybe even the complete lyrics to the songs.
In other words, a cheat sheet that really helps you understand the music.

These liner notes have answers and basic explanations to the _Check Yourself..._ questions from the chapters.
These aren't meant to be comprehensive answers, just a little information so you can confirm you're...well, I hate to say it, but...on the right _track_.

The review questions are intended to be a little open-ended, so your answers will vary from these.

=== Soundcheck

[qanda]
*What tools do you need to develop C# programs?*::
You'll need an IDE and the .NET SDK.

*What does IDE stand for and what is it's role in software development?*::
IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It's the software you'll use to write your C# code.

*What IDE did you choose? Why?*::
Anything is fine, as long as it supports C#! Popular choices include Visual Studio Community, Visual Studio Code, and JetBrains Rider.

// TODO: Link "Back to &lt;&lt;_getting_started&gt;&gt;" but with anchor to review questions.

[[computers-and-coding]]
=== 1. Computers and Coding

[qanda]

*What is the primary role of a programming language in the context of computer programming?*::
The primary role of a programming language is to act as a bridge between human language and machine language. It allows humans to write instructions in a way that is easier for them to understand and use, which can then be accurately translated into machine language that a computer can execute.

*What happens when you run a C# program? Describe that process in simple terms.*::
When you run a C# program, your code gets compiled (translated) into something the computer can understand, then the computer follows your instructions step by step and shows the results (like printing text or doing math).

*What's the difference between Console.Write() and Console.WriteLine()? When would you use each?*::
Console.Write() prints text and keeps the cursor on the same line. Console.WriteLine() prints text and moves the cursor to a new line. Use Write() when you want output to continue on the same line, and WriteLine() when you want it to start a new line afterward.

*How would you explain what a “program” is to an 8-year-old?*::
A program is like a list of instructions you give to a computer—kind of like a recipe. The computer follows the steps exactly to do something, like showing a message or solving a puzzle.

*Explain the difference between compiled and interpreted programming languages. Describe how C# is both compiled *and* interpreted.*::
   - *Compiled languages* are those where the source code is translated into machine language by a compiler before the program is run. This machine language file can then be executed directly by the computer. An example of a compiled language is C.
   - *Interpreted languages* are those where the source code is translated into machine language on the fly, as the program is running, by an interpreter. An example of an interpreted language is Python.
   - *C#* is a somewhat unique case, as it is both compiled and interpreted. The source code is first compiled into an intermediate language called CIL, which is then interpreted by the .NET runtime (CLR) when the program is executed. This allows C# to have some of the performance benefits of compiled languages while still being able to run on different platforms.

[[variables-and-data-types]]
=== 2. Variables and Data Types

[qanda]
*What is a variable, and why do we use them in programming?*::
A variable is a named storage location in a program that holds a value which can change as the program runs. We use variables to store, update, and reuse data.

*Which C# data type would you use for each of the following?*::
	- *The number of people in The Beatles* → `int`
	- *The full name of the Beatles bass player* → `string`
	- *Whether the Beatles are a great band (yes or no)* → `bool`
	- *The price of _Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band_ on vinyl* → `double`
	- *John Lennon's middle initial (it's W, incidentally)* → `char`

*Write a line of code that declares a variable named importantYear and sets it to 1964.*::
+
[source,csharp]
int importantYear = 1964;

*What will the following code print? Why?*::
+
[source,csharp,linenums]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>string drummer = "Pete Best";
drummer = "Ringo Starr";
Console.WriteLine(drummer);</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The code will print "Ringo Starr" because the variable `drummer` is first set to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Best["Pete Best"^] and then changed to "Ringo Starr". The most recent value assigned to the variable is what gets printed.

*What happens if you try to store a word (like "hello") in a variable declared as `int`?*::
The program will not compile. You can't assign a value of one data type to a variable of another (incompatible) data type. You also can't change the data type of a variable after you've declared it.

*What's wrong with this variable name: `4ladsFromLiverpool`?*::
A C# variable name can't start with a number. You could call it `fourLadsFromLiverpool` instead.

*_True_ or _False_: You must always assign a value to a variable at the same time you declare it*::
*False.* You can declare a variable and assign a value to it later:

</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>[[methods]]
=== 3. Methods

[qanda]

*What is a method, and why would you use one in your code?*::
A method is a named block of code that does something—like a mini-program inside your program. You use methods to organize your code, avoid repetition, and make your program easier to understand and manage. (Like reusable LEGO chunks.)

*What's the difference between calling a method and defining a method?*::
Defining a method is writing what the method does. Calling a method is telling it to actually run. You define once, but can call it as many times as you want.

*What does the keyword `void` mean in a method definition?*::
`void` means the method doesn't return anything. It just does something, like printing text, but doesn't give a value back.

*Consider the code below. How would you call it to greet someone named "Brian Epstein"?*::
+
[source,csharp,linenums]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>static void Greet(string name)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Hello, {name}!");
}</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>+
[source,csharp]Greet("Brian Epstein");

*Why is it a good idea to define reusable code inside a method instead of copying and pasting it everywhere?*::

Defining reusable code inside a method is better than copying and pasting because it makes your code cleaner, easier to read, and less error-prone. If you need to change the code later, you only have to do it in one place instead of everywhere you pasted it. It also ensures that each copy of the code does the same thing, reducing the chance of mistakes.

*Consider the code below. a. Overload the method by accepting the name of a band to introduce. b. Demonstrate how to call each version of the method.*::
+
[source,csharp,linenums]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>static void AnnounceBand()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Ladies and gentlemen, The Beatles!");
}</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>+
a. Overloaded method:
+
[source,csharp,linenums]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>static void AnnounceBand(string bandName)
{
	Console.WriteLine($"Ladies and gentlemen, {bandName}!");
}</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>+
b. Calling each version:
+
[source,csharp,linenums]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AnnounceBand(); // Calls the original method
AnnounceBand("The Rolling Stones"); // Calls the overloaded method</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>*What happens if you define a method with a parameter but forget to provide an argument when you call it?*::

If you define a method with a parameter but forget to provide an argument when you call it, the program will not compile. The compiler will give an error because it expects an argument for the parameter.

*What do we call the variable inside a method's parentheses? How is it different from an argument?*::

The variable inside a method's parentheses is called a *parameter*. It's a placeholder for the value that will be passed to the method when it's called. An *argument* is the actual value you provide when you call the method. For example, in `greet("Brian Epstein")`, "Brian Epstein" is the argument, and `name` in `greet(string name)` is the parameter.


[[decisions]]
=== 4. Decisions

[qanda]

*What type of value or expression must go inside the parentheses of an if statement?*::

The parentheses of an `if` statement must contain a `bool` value or expression. This determines whether the code inside the `if` block will run.

*Write an `if` statement that checks if the variable `volume` is less than 11. If it is, print "This amp goes to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xgx4k83zzc[eleven^]!".*::
+
[source,csharp,linenums]</pre>

	Console.WriteLine("This amp goes to eleven!");

The `==` operator checks if two values are equal. It's used in Boolean expressions like `if` statements. The `=` operator is used for assignment, to set a variable's value. For example, `x = 5` assigns 5 to x, while `if (x == 5)` checks if x is equal to 5.

*Explain the difference between using `else if` and just writing another `if` statement?*::

`else if` is only evaluated if the first `if` is false.
A separate `if` is evaluated no matter what—even if the previous one was true.

*Write a comment that explains the following code:*::
+
[source,csharp,linenums]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>if (scratchCount &gt;= 3 &amp;&amp; scratchCount &#8656; 6)
{
    condition = "very good";
}</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>+
This code checks if the variable `scratchCount` is between 3 and 6 (inclusive). If it is, it sets the variable `condition` to "very good". The `&amp;&amp;` operator means both conditions must be true for the code inside the block to run.

*Rewrite the following `if-else if` structure using a `switch` statement:*::
+
[source,csharp,linenums]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>if (trackNumber == 1)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Playing: Brown Sugar");
}
else if (trackNumber == 2)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Playing: Sway");
}
else if (trackNumber == 3)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Playing: Wild Horses");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Playing: Unknown Track");
}</p>

=== 5. Loops

[qanda]
*Explain the difference between a definite loop and an indefinite loop?*::
+
* A *definite* loop runs a set number of times (for example, a for loop that runs 10 times).
+
* An *indefinite* loop runs until some condition changes, so the number of times it repeats isn’t known ahead of time (for example, a while loop that keeps going until the user types “quit”).

*In a `while` loop, what happens if the Boolean condition is `false` on the first check?*::
If the Boolean condition is `false` on the first check, the code inside the `while` loop will not run at all. The program will skip the loop and continue with the next part of the code.

*Describe one way an infinite loop can occur.*::
An infinite loop can occur if the condition in a `while` loop never becomes `false`. This can happen if you forget to update the variable that the condition checks, or if the update logic is incorrect. For example, if you have `while (count &lt; 10)` but never increase `count` inside the loop, it will run forever.

*When doing input validation with loops, why might a do-while loop be preferable to a while loop?*::
A `do-while` loop always executes at least once, so the user is guaranteed to be asked for input before the condition is checked.

*List and describe the three parts of a for loop in C#.*::
+
* Initialization – runs once before the loop starts (e.g., int i = 0).
+
* Condition – checked with each loop iteration; the loop continues while it's true (e.g., i &lt; 5).
+
* Update – runs after each loop iteration, usually adjusting the loop variable (e.g., i++).

*Explain what the break statement does inside a loop.*::
It immediately exits the loop, skipping any remaining iterations, and continues execution after the loop.

*Explain what the continue statement does inside a loop.*::
It skips the rest of the current iteration and re-checks the loop condition for the next cycle.

[[debugging-and-generative-ai]]
=== 6. Debugging and Generative AI

[qanda]
*What is the difference between a compile-time error and a runtime error?*::
*Compile-time errors* occur when the compiler cannot translate the source code into machine code due to syntax or semantic issues. These errors must be fixed before the program can run. *Runtime errors*, on the other hand, occur during the execution of the program and are often due to logic errors, causing the program to behave unexpectedly or crash.

*How can using output statements help in debugging a program?*::
Output statements, such as `print()` statements, allow you to monitor the values of variables and the flow of execution in your program. This visibility helps you pinpoint where things are going wrong, making it easier to identify and correct errors.

*What are some strategies you can use when you're frustrated by a bug in your code?*::
When you're frustrated by a bug in your code, take a break to clear your mind and return with fresh eyes. Use output statements to track variables and execution flow, clean up your code for better readability, and break down the problem into smaller parts. If needed, seek help from others and stay patient, knowing that debugging is a valuable part of the learning process.

[qanda]

*What are the two main parts of a test case, and why is it important to define them before you start writing code?*::
A test case includes *inputs* (the data the program uses) and the *expected output* (the result the program should produce). Defining test cases before coding helps you understand the problem better and plan how your program will work, instead of just jumping in and hoping it all comes together.

*Why is it not enough to test your program with just one set of inputs? Give an example of an “edge case” that might catch a bug.*::
One test case might only show that your code works in that specific situation. To be sure your program works in general, you need to test it with a variety of inputs, including unusual or tricky ones.
+
An example of an edge case: If you're writing a program that determines if a person is old enough to vote, the input 17 should return "no"; 18 should return "yes".

*How can writing your test cases early help you figure out what variables or calculations your program will need?*::
Thinking through test cases makes you figure out the steps to solve the problem. It helps you see what data you need, what formulas you'll use, and what your program should do at each stage. It's like using the test cases to reverse-engineer your program before you even start coding.

[[deep-cuts]]
== Deep Cuts
[.subtitle]
WTF a "deep cut"?

// TODO: Rewrite for only Deep Cuts
Some artists value the idea of an album as a unified creative work, and they put a lot of thought into which songs go on an album—and in what order.
They might want a really catchy song at the start of the album, a strong start to the second side, and a big (or thought-provoking) finish.

A song is called a "cut" because a recording master was made by literally cutting a groove into a disc, and artists would _cut a song_ in the studio. A *deep cut* is a song buried deep in an album that isn't a radio single but is still great—the kind of song that becomes a fan favorite.
Check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nryc7h6TCIE["Loving Cup"^], which is smack dab in the middle of _Exile on Main St._ and is easily overlooked among the hits all over that album.

This section is like that: cool stuff that isn't critical enough to include in the chapter, but might turn out to be really interesting or useful.
I like the C# language a lot, and there are a ton of great features that I don't get into because I know many of my students don't need a bunch of extra stuff thrown at them.
So this is where I can put some of that stuff.
They're brief and, where appropriate, I link to a reliable source of additional information on the topic.

And just to be clear, this is what a normal books would call the *appendices*...

=== Binary Numbers and How Computers Work
[.subtitle]
Deep Cut from Chapter 1 - &lt;&lt;_computers_and_coding&gt;&gt;

The chapters of this eBook are subtitled using binary to show basic examples of the numbering system: 0001 is, well, 1 in decimal.
And 0100 is 4 in decimal. We won't get into binary numbers, but it's not very complicated and is kind of interesting if you're a nerd.

The amazing https://code.org[code.org] project has a playlist of great, short videos on how computers work—including binary numbers—if you want to know a little more without going too crazy:

=== `string.Format()` Method
[.subtitle]
Deep Cut from Chapter 2 - &lt;&lt;_variables_and_data_types&gt;&gt;

You can also place variable values in a string using the `string.Format()` method.
This method accepts a string with numbered placeholders, along with the variables you want to insert—in the order they appear in the string.

[caption="Example {chapter-number}.{counter:source-counter} - "]
.Outtputting variables with interpolation - alternative
[source,csharp,linenums]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>string artistName = "Elvis Presley";
int birthYear = 1935;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>string output = string.Format("{0} was born in {1}", artistName, birthYear);</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Console.WriteLine(output);</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The `{0}` and `{1}` in the string act as placeholders, and then the values are added on with commas after the string.
`artistName` is the first variable listed, so it goes in the first placeholder; `birthYear` is the second variable listed, so it goes in the second placeholder.

Beginners might find this style a little more confusing, but programmers coming to C# from some other languages might find it familiar.
And interpoliation is a relatively new addition to C# (around 2015, I believe), so you might still see older code using `string.Format()`.

=== Optional Arguments
[.subtitle]
Deep Cut from Chapter 3 - &lt;&lt;_methods&gt;&gt;

C# allows us to specify that some arguments are optional.
By default (the way we've defined parameters so far), a method call must provide a value for each parameter in the method.
However, you can also assign a default value to a parameter; that makes it optional.

[caption="Example A{counter:source-counter} - "]
.{github-base}/{github-folder}/OptionalArgument.cs[`OptionalArgument.cs`]. A method with an optional argument.
[source,csharp,linenums]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>public static double TotalBill(double meal, double tipPercentage = 20.0) {
   return meal + (meal * tipPercentage/100);
}</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>When calling `TotalBill`, we can provide one argument (price of the meal) or two (price of the meal and the tip percentage).
If we don't provide `tipPercentage`, the method will use `20.0` for that parameter.

```csharp
double amount = TotalBill(100.0);  // amount = 120.0
double amount2 = TotalBill(100.0, 18.0);  // amount2 = 118.0
```

IMPORTANT: If you use optional parameters, they must be at the end of the parameter list. In other words, in the example above, I couldn't have the optional `tipPercentage` before `meal`.

Learn more about optional parameters in the official Microsoft documentation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/named-and-optional-arguments#optional-arguments[Optional Arguments (C# Programming Guide)^]

=== Named Arguments
[.subtitle]
Deep Cut from Chapter 3 - &lt;&lt;_methods&gt;&gt;

Another nice C# feature related methods is named arguments.
Named arguments allow you to specify the name of the parameter you're providing a value for, so you can list the arguments in any order. Simply put the name of the parameter followed by a colon and the value you want to assign to it.

It means you don't have to remember the order of the parameters in the method as long as you remember the names.

        Console.WriteLine(amount);</p>

        }
    }

=== Nested Method Calls
[.subtitle]
Deep Cut from Chapter 3 - &lt;&lt;_methods&gt;&gt;

#Coming Soon!#

// Nesting method calls means calling a method inside another method call. You’re basically using the result of one method directly as the input for another.

// Example: nexting a Console.ReadLine() inside a Convert.ToInt32() method call.

=== Music Stuff

I'm not a musician, and really am no more of a fan than the average person.
But I am nerdy about music history, and especially the cultural impact of music.

A lot of the stupid little references in the book and videos are just things I happen to know; in some cases I just jump over to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page[Wikipedia^] and find something that's interesting and is documented well enough that I trust it to be true.

If you're interested in music (well, rock music) history, there are a few things I can recommend:

* https://500songs.com[A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs^] by Andrew Hickey. This is an amazing ongoing podcast that is doing just what the title says, starting all the way back in 1939 and moving chronologically from there. It's incredibly well-researched, and Andrew does such a good job of using these individual songs to create a cohesive narrative.
* https://www.peterguralnick.com/[Peter Guralnick^] is a music historian and biographer who specializes in early rock and roll. His two-volume biography of Elvis Presley (_Last Train to Memphis_ and _Careless Love_) is widely considered the definitive work on Elvis. His biography of Sam Phillips (_Sam Phillips: The Man Who Invented Rock 'n' Roll_) is also excellent and covers Sun Records and the early days of rock and roll. I haven't gotten to his Sam Cooke biography yet, but it's on my list.
* https://www.marklewisohn.net/[Mark Lewisohn^] is a Beatles historian and author of https://www.marklewisohn.net/tune-in/[Tune In^], which is the first book in a planned three-volume biography of the Beatles. It's a massive book, but it's incredibly well-researched and provides a detailed look at the Beatles' early years. The extended edition is an astonishing 1,700 pages long, and only covers to the end of 1962—before the band even released their first album! If you want a deep dive into their time in Hamburg, this book is for you. Beatles fans everywhere are impatiently awaiting the next volume.
* https://www.cocaineandrhinestones.com[Cocaine &amp; Rhinestones^] by Tyler Mahan Coe. Another well-researched podcast, this one focuses on country music. I don't listen to country music, but based on the title alone, I figured it was worth a listen. Turns out, it's great—even for someone who doesn't really like country.</pre>
