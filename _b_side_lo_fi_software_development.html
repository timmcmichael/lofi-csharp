<p><em>In the days when we all got our music on vinyl, a single wasn&#8217;t something you played on Spotify or Apple Music—you went down to the record store and bought it.
The single would take up one side of the record, and the artist could put another song on the back.
The <strong>A-side</strong> was the hit everyone knew from the radio, and the <strong>B-side</strong> was a lesser-known track—sometimes a buried treasure, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u90beUXTKwo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"God Only Knows"</a> on the B-side of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmcNbsLCpBQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Wouldn&#8217;t It Be Nice"</a>.</em></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Beginners learn to code by learning individual programming skills and concepts, like variables, loops, and methods.
Typically, we write small programs that focus on one or two of those concepts at a time; in a school setting, the teacher generally assigns problems that are intentionally limited, keeping the work simple and allowing the teacher to assess mastery of specific skills.
But for coding to be useful, we have to put those skills to use in larger projects that solve real problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That&#8217;s difficult to do in the context of a class, where time is limited and the teacher is obligated to cover specific topics&#8212;&#8203;often at a demanding pace that leaves little room for exploration.
So this chapter zooms out to look at the bigger picture of software development.
If you go into a career as a developer—or engage in large-scale personal projects—these topics will be a part of your everyday work.
If you aren&#8217;t a developer but work elsewhere in tech, understanding broad software development concepts will help you collaborate effectively with coders and technical teams.
And even if you never write another line of code after this course, knowing a little about software development will help you understand how software works and why it sometimes doesn&#8217;t.</p>

<h3 id="_habits_and_mindset">Habits and Mindset</h3>
<div class="paragraph subtitle">
<p>Think Like a Professional Developer</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Successful developers cultivate habits and attitudes that help them continuously improve their skills and make them effective members of a development team.
When possible, I&#8217;ve tried to encourage these habits throughout our learning in this book and videos, but it&#8217;s important to identify some of them explicitly:</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_iterative_development">Iterative Development</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Very few programs, algorithms, or features are written perfectly on the first try.
Instead, most good developers write a small piece of code and focus on getting it working; then they repeat the process for the next piece, and the next, until the entire program is complete.
This approach—called <em>iterative development</em>—helps keep us from getting overwhelmed by a large or complex task; just break it down into smaller pieces, and focus on one piece at a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If also helps us identify and fix problems early, before we have other code depending on it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Beginning coders can develop this mindset in a few ways:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Work the important stuff first</dt>
<dd>
<p>Identify the core functionality for the code you&#8217;re developing, and work on that first. For example, get the calculations working correctly before you worry about getting user input or displaying output nicely.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Run your code frequently</dt>
<dd>
<p>After you write a few lines of code, run it and see how it behaves. If if it doesn&#8217;t produce visible evidence of how it&#8217;s working, you can at least verify that it compiles and runs without errors.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Test small pieces</dt>
<dd>
<p>Once you have a small piece of code working, test it with different inputs or data to make sure it behaves correctly in a variety of situations.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_refactoring">Refactoring</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As part of our iterative development process, we might find that our code works correctly, but could be improved in some way.
Maybe it&#8217;s repetitive, or too long, or hard to read, or inefficient.
Or, maybe it doesn&#8217;t conform to best practices or coding standards.
When we identify these kinds of issues, we can go back and improve the code without changing its behavior; this process is called <em>refactoring</em>.
Refactoring is an important skill for developers to cultivate, as it helps keep code maintainable and adaptable to future changes.</p>

<h4 id="_documentation">Documentation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest; I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve ever met a developer who <strong>wants</strong> to write documentation.
But, whether we like it or not, documentation is an essential part of software development.
And to reiterate: documenting our code <strong>is part of software development</strong>, not an extra thing we do at the end if we have time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Good documentation helps others (and our future selves) understand how our code works, how to use it, and how to maintain it.
Documentation can take many forms, including:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Comments within the code itself (inline comments, method headers, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>README files (files that explain how to use a project or application)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>API documentation (documents that explain how to use specific functions or classes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User manuals (documentation for the end users of the software)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a professional setting, documentation standards are often established by the development team or organization, and may be enforced through code reviews or other quality assurance processes.
In other words, your code won&#8217;t get incorporated into the project until you&#8217;ve written high quality documentation.
In other <em>other</em> words, you&#8217;re no use to an employer if you can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t document your work effectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In my classes, I ask students to include a comment block at the top of each program that includes some basic information, but not much beyond that—I&#8217;m really just trying to get beginners into the habit of including some documentation, and ingraining the idea that documentation is part of the coding process.
You should be aware that most professional development teams have much more extensive documentation requirements, so be prepared to adapt to those expectations in your future work.</p>

<h4 id="_software_development_ethics">Software Development Ethics</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Computers are embedded in nearly every aspect of our lives, making software developers an important influence on society.
As developers, we have a responsibility to consider the ethical implications of our work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Golden Rule</em> suggests that we should treat others as we would like to be treated; in software development, we could adapt that to say:</p>

<p>Here are a few thoughts to consider as you develop software:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>You&#8217;re responsible for the software you develop</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Your software will be used by real people and on real data. Be aware of the consequences of your work—and the consequences of errors in your work. Another professor I know asks his students, "Would you fly in an airplane that depended on your code to stay in the air?"</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Consider privacy and data handling</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>We&#8217;ve all grown accustomed to the idea that data is collected about us whenever we use software. But as developers, we need to be thoughtful about what data we collect, how we store it, how we protect it, and who we share it with.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Think about security</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Most security issues are beyond our scope here, but as you continue to learn, be mindful of security best practices. Design software with security in mind from the beginning, rather than as something you add when you&#8217;re done.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Think about accessibility</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Software should be usable by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities. Consider accessibility features and best practices to ensure your software is inclusive. Remember that accessible design is good design for everyone!</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Respect intellectual property</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Copyright applies to code just as it does to other creative works. Don&#8217;t use code you&#8217;re not authorized to use, and always respect the licensing terms of any libraries or frameworks you incorporate into your projects. And just like in other ares of your life, cite your sources!</p>

<p>Staying current with new programming languages, frameworks, tools, and best practices is essential for long-term success as a developer.

<div class="paragraph subtitle">
<p>Different Ways to Think About Code</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Programming paradigms</em> are different approaches or styles of programming that provide distinct ways to think about and structure code.
Different paradigms offer different techniques for solving problems and different philosophies about how code should be developed and organized.
These paradigms are huge topics that could be entire books and courses of their own, so we&#8217;re just going to identify a few of the most common ones here.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Procedural Programming</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Programs are organized around procedures or routines—what we have been calling <em>methods</em>. To design a program from this perspective, we break down the program into a series of steps or procedures that execute in a specific order. We were using this approach throughout the first six chapters of this book, but it&#8217;s usefulness is not limited to beginners; procedural programming is still widely used in industry for many types of applications.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>OOP programs are organized around objects, which bundle code with the data it operates on, and a program works by creating and interacting with these objects. OOP is popular in industry and lends itself well to large, complex software systems. We began exploring OOP in the chapter on <a href="_classes_and_objects.html">Classes and Objects</a>.</p>

<p>Instead of specifying how to perform tasks step-by-step, declarative programming focuses on what the program should accomplish.

<p>Learning to write code means creating a lot of programs—mostly small, straightforward programs at first.
Remember those awful word problems where a train leaves Chicago traveling 40 mph, and another train leaves Denver at 35 mph?
That kind of stuff; but in my course, we don&#8217;t get too caught up in the math part of it.
But we care <strong>a lot</strong> about understanding the requirements of a program and implementing it successfully.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As our programs become bigger and more complex, we&#8217;ll need to work within a deliberate design and implementation process in order to keep ourselves organized and focused.
Even the smaller programs we&#8217;ll develop while learning the basics will benefit from a thoughtful approach beyond just opening a new file and starting to type.
It ensures that we use our time efficiently.
And when we are faced with solving a programming problem that really intimidates us, the process will help make the task more approachable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For big or small projects, a good general approach to software development is:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Planning and Analysis</dt>
<dd>
<p>Identify the goals and scope of the program. As a rule, keep it small and focused—we can always add features later. <strong>Ask yourself, <em>What does this program need to do?</em></strong></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Testing Plan</dt>
<dd>
<p>Determine how the final program will be tested. The testing plan will be useful, but most importantly, taking the time to establish a specific testing plan ensures that we thoroughly understand the program before we begin writing code. If we don&#8217;t know how the program will work, we&#8217;re not yet ready to begin coding. <strong>Ask yourself, <em>How will I make sure the program works correctly?</em></strong></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Implementation</dt>
<dd>
<p>Write and test the code. We say that this is an <em>iterative</em> (or "repeating") process, meaning we&#8217;ll write and test one small piece, staying with it until we know it&#8217;s good. Then we&#8217;ll move on to the next piece and repeat. <strong>Ask yourself, <em>What code do I need in order to get the next part of the program working?</em></strong></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Deployment</dt>
<dd>
<p>Once the program is complete and has passed all tests, it&#8217;s time to deploy it. This might mean sharing it with users, installing it on a server, or simply submitting it for a class assignment. <strong>Ask yourself, <em>How will I deliver this program to its users?</em></strong></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Revise or maintain</dt>
<dd>
<p>If our needs or program requirements change, we&#8217;ll need to go back to the first step and begin planning the next version. If not, we&#8217;ll need to monitor that the program continues to perform as expected over time. <strong>Ask yourself, <em>What&#8217;s next for this program?</em></strong></p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ll flesh out this process as we go—and as our programs become more advanced.</p>
